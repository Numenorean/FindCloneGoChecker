Simple non-multithreaded checker has written on Golang
I've been working on multithreaded version, but hasn't do it yet, it's pretty hard

Already done:
- Proxy support (all types)
- Reading combos from file
- Log formatting
- Flexible modification for new checker

TODO:
- Multithreading
- Write hits to file
- Pause
- GUI
- Prettier logic of checker (now it's very badly in something places)
