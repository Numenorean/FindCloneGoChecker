Example of simple ~~non-multithreaded~~ already multithreaded checker has written on Golang

Already done:
- Proxy support (all types)
- Reading combos from file
- Log formatting
- Flexible modification for new checker
- Multithreading
- Write hits to file
- Hits and customs Sorting
- Showing statistic in console title


TODO:
- Pause
- GUI
- Prettier logic of checker (now it's very badly in something places)
